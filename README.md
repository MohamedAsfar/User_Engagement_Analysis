## DEFINE

Zilto is a business-to-business professional services company that provides online services and products to support work of the employees of its customer companies. Many companies in diverse areas of business including, for example, manufacturers, producers, suppliers, retailers, transportation, and others are Zilto’s paid subscribers. Besides an annual subscription fee, variable charges are based on the extent of engagement with its products and services by the users (users are employees of customer companies).
The responsibility is to monitor user activity and engagement(whether engagement is stable, dropping, or increasing). For any changes in user engagement activity,possible sources or reasons for the changes should be identified and noted. The task at hand is to review the available data, do necessary analysis, interpret the findings and project visualizations for user engagement.
